      <description>(TL;DR: This post-includes a disagreement on the output of the R package MuMIn, which computes model-averaged predictions and coefficients. But I don’t get to this until point 6 below.)
This post is a follow up to my inital post, which was written as as a way for me to pen my mental thoughts on the recent review of “Model averaging in ecology: a review of Bayesian, information‐theoretic and tactical approaches for predictive inference”.</description>
