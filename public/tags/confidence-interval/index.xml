      <description>This is part II of how to represent uncertainty in the mean response of each treatment level. A 1 SE bar, where the SE is computed for each group independently, is nearly universal in much of biology. Part I explains why I prefer confidence intervals to SE bars and explores several alternative methods for computing a CI. One alternative is a non-parametric bootstrap. I like the bootstrap – it is extremely useful for learning and teaching what “frequentist” means.</description>

      <description>Researchers frequently report results as relative effects, for example,
“Male flies from selected lines had 50% larger upwind flight ability than male flies from control lines (Control mean: 117.5 cm/s; Selected mean 176.5 cm/s).”
where a relative effect is
\[\begin{equation} 100 \frac{\bar{y}_B - \bar{y}_A}{\bar{y}_A} \end{equation}\] If we are to follow best practices, we should present this effect with a measure of uncertainty, such as a confidence interval. The absolute effect is 59.</description>
