      <description>tl;dr Standard procedure in labs is to normalize values from gels/blots/etc by some standard that is expected to be constant across treatments. A problem with this is regression to the mean, which results in inflated Type I error. This means t-tests and such are too liberal, that is, we reject the null to often, or we conclude “an effect exists” when the evidence doesn’t favor this conclusion too often. The correct was to achieve the same goals as normalization is a linear model with the reference value as a covariate.</description>
