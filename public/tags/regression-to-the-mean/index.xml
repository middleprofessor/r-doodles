      <description>Background Reproducibility What are the consequences of normalization? Compare to linear model with Gapdh as covariate linear models  Simulations Simulation functions functions to plot simulation results Results and consequences    This not fully fleshed out post has two tl;drs, the first is specific to the paper (see below), the second is very general, for anyone normalizing gel/blot/etc. data.
tl;dr 1 The linear model with Gapdh as covariate fit to the empirical data from the paper is inconclusive while the model with the normalization used by the authors has a very low p-value for both Met and pMet</description>
