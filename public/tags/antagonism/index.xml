      <description>motivating source: Integration of two herbivore-induced plant volatiles results in synergistic effects on plant defense and resistance
What is synergism or antagonism? (this post is a follow up to What is an interaction?)
In the experiment for Figure 1 of the motivating source article, the researchers were explicitly interested in measuring any synergistic effects of hac and indole on the response. What is a synergistic effect? If hac and indole act independently, then the response should be additive â€“ the HAC+Indole effect should simply be the sum of the independent HAC and Indole effects.</description>
