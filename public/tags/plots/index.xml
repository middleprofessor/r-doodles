      <description>The example data are from Figure 4b of
Gómez-Banoy, Nicolás, et al. “Adipsin preserves beta cells in diabetic mice and associates with protection from type 2 diabetes in humans.” Nature medicine 25.11 (2019): 1739-1747.

The design is \(2 \times 2\) factorial (two experimental factors each with two levels). I probably wouldn’t communicate treatments this way but it does have the advantage that treatment combinations are easy to see even if the plot were black-and-white (but why would anyone use black and white in 2020?</description>

      <description>A Harrell plot combines a forest plot of estimated treatment effects and uncertainty, a dot plot of raw data, and a box plot of the distribution of the raw data into a single plot. A Harrell plot encourages best practices such as exploration of the distribution of the data and focus on effect size and uncertainty, while discouraging bad practices such as ignoring distributions and focusing on \(p\)-values. Consequently, a Harrell plot should replace the bar plots and Cleveland dot plots that are currently ubiquitous in the literature.</description>
