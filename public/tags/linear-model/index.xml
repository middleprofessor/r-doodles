      <description>This is fake data that simulates an experiment to measure effect of treatment on fat weight. The treatment is “diet” with two levels: “control” (blue dots) and “treated” (gold dots). Diet has a large effect on total body weight. The simulated data look like that in the plot above (and very much like the real data).
The question is, what are problems with using an “ancova” linear model to estimate the direct effect of treatment on fat weight?</description>

      <description>This doodle was motivated Jake Westfall’s answer to a Cross-Validated question.
The short answer is yes but most R scripts that I’ve found on the web are unsatisfying because only the t-value reproduces, not the df and p-value. Jake notes the reason for this in his answer on Cross-Validated.
To get the adjusted df, and the p-value associated with this, one can use the emmeans package by Russell Lenth, as he notes here.</description>
