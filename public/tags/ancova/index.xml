      <description>Background Reproducibility What are the consequences of normalization? Compare to linear model with Gapdh as covariate linear models  Simulations Simulation functions functions to plot simulation results Results and consequences    This not fully fleshed out post has two tl;drs, the first is specific to the paper (see below), the second is very general, for anyone normalizing gel/blot/etc. data.
tl;dr 1 The linear model with Gapdh as covariate fit to the empirical data from the paper is inconclusive while the model with the normalization used by the authors has a very low p-value for both Met and pMet</description>

      <description>“A more efficient design would be to first group the rats into homogeneous subsets based on baseline food consumption. This could be done by ranking the rats from heaviest to lightest eaters and then grouping them into pairs by taking the first two rats (the two that ate the most during baseline), then the next two in the list, and so on. The difference from a completely randomised design is that one rat within each pair is randomised to one of the treatment groups, and the other rat is then assigned to the remaining treatment group.</description>

      <title>Covariate adjustment in randomized experiments</title>

      <description>The post motivated by a tweetorial from Darren Dahly
In an experiment, do we adjust for covariates that differ between treatment levels measured pre-experiment (“imbalance” in random assignment), where a difference is inferred from a t-test with p &amp;lt; 0.05? Or do we adjust for all covariates, regardless of differences pre-test? Or do we adjust only for covariates that have sustantial correlation with the outcome? Or do we not adjust at all?</description>

      <description>This post is motivated by a twitter link to a recent blog post critical of the old but influential study An obesity-associated gut microbiome with increased capacity for energy harvest with impressive citation metrics. In the post, Matthew Dalby smartly used the available data to reconstruct the final weights of the two groups. He showed these final weights were nearly the same, which is not good evidence for a treatment effect, given that the treatment was randomized among groups.</description>
