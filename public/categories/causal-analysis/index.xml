      <description>This is a skeletal post to work up an answer to a twitter question using Wright’s rules of path models. Using this panel A from this figure
fn &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;proxy_dag.jpg&amp;quot; fig_path &amp;lt;- here::here(&amp;quot;content/images&amp;quot;) knitr::include_graphics(fig_path) the question is I want to know about A-&amp;gt;Y but I measure A* and Y*. So in figure A, is the bias the backdoor path from A* to Y* through A and Y?
If the data are standardized (everything as unit variance) This is easy and just uses Wright’s rules of adding up effects along a path</description>
