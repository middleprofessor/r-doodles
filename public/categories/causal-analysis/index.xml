      <description>This is a skeletal post to work up an answer to a twitter question using Wrightâ€™s rules of path models. Using this figure
from Panel A of a figure from Hernan and Cole. The scribbled red path coefficients are added
 the question is I want to know about A-&amp;gt;Y but I measure A* and Y*. So in figure A, is the bias the backdoor path from A* to Y* through A and Y?</description>
