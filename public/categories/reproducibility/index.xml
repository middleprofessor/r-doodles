      <description>Background Reproducibility What are the consequences of normalization? Compare to linear model with Gapdh as covariate linear models  Simulations Simulation functions functions to plot simulation results Results and consequences    This not fully fleshed out post has two tl;drs, the first is specific to the paper (see below), the second is very general, for anyone normalizing gel/blot/etc. data.
tl;dr 1 The linear model with Gapdh as covariate fit to the empirical data from the paper is inconclusive while the model with the normalization used by the authors has a very low p-value for both Met and pMet</description>

      <description>Update - This post has been updated
A very skeletal analysis of
Sharon, G., Cruz, N.J., Kang, D.W., Gandal, M.J., Wang, B., Kim, Y.M., Zink, E.M., Casey, C.P., Taylor, B.C., Lane, C.J. and Bramer, L.M., 2019. Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Promote Behavioral Symptoms in Mice. Cell, 177(6), pp.1600-1618.
which got some attention on pubpeer.
Commenters are questioning the result of Fig1G. It is very hard to infer a p-value from plots like these, where the data are multi-level, regardless of if means and some kind of error bar is presented.</description>
