      <description>An R doodle is a short script to check intuition or understanding. Almost always, this involves generating fake data. I might create an R doodle when Iâ€™m reviewing a manuscript or reading a published paper and I want to check if their statistical analysis is doing what the authors think it is doing. Or maybe I create it to help me figure out what the authors are doing. Or I might be teaching some method and I create an R doodle to help me understand how the method behaves given different input (fake) data sets.</description>
