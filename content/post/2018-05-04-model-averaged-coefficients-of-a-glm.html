<p>This is a very quick post as a comment to the statement</p>
<p>“For linear models, predicting from a parameter-averaged model is mathematically identical to averaging predictions, but this is not the case for non-linear models…For non-linear models, such as GLMs with log or logit link functions g(x)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, such coefficient averaging is not equivalent to prediction averaging.”</p>
<p>from the supplement of Dormann et al. <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecm.1309" target="_blank">Model averaging in ecology: a review of Bayesian, information‐theoretic and tactical approaches for predictive inference</a>.</p>
<p>This is within the context of problems with model-averaged coefficients. I think the authors are arguing that for GLMs, we cannot use model-averaged predictions to justify interpreting model-averaged coefficients since modeled-averaged coefficients are not the same thing that produced the model-averaged predictions. I think this is wrong, model-averaged coefficients <em>are</em> the same thing that produced the model-averaged predictions <em>if</em> both are averaged on the link scale.</p>
<p>Here is their equation S2</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m{g^{-1}(Xb_i)} \ne g^{-1}(X \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m{b_i}}{m})
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>This equation is true but, I think, irrelevant. The LHS averages predictions, but the average is on the response scale. The RHS averages the coefficients, but the average is on the link scale. I would agree with the statement <em>if</em> this is the way researchers are averaging (although I would think naive researchers would be averaging coefficients on the response scale and predictions on the link scale)</p>
<p>I would think the LHS is the incorrect method for computing predictions on the response scale. With all averaging on the link scale, equation S2 becomes</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
g^{-1}(\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m{(Xb_i)}) = g^{-1}(X \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m{b_i}}{m})
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>The RHS is the same as their S2. The LHS computes the prediction for each model on the link scale, then averages over these on the link scale, and then back-transforms to the response scale. Both LHS and RHS are correct ways to get the model-averaged predictions on the response scale. And, both the LHS and RHS are equivalent and show that “predicting from a parameter-averaged model [RHS] is mathematically identical to averaging predictions [LHS].”</p>
<p><strong>In short.</strong> Model-averaged coefficients should be averaged on the link scale. It would indeed be not “correct” to interpret coefficients that are model-averaged on the response scale, although as Dormann et al state, “In practice, however, both log and logit are sufficiently linear, making coefficient averaging an acceptable approximation.” If the issue is that researchers are model averaging coefficients on the response scale, this isn’t an issue with model averaging coefficients in general, but only of model-averaging coefficients on a response scale.</p>
<p>Here is a short R-doodle showing that “predicting from a parameter-averaged model is mathematically identical to averaging predictions” for a GLM, as long as one is doing all the averaging on the link scale</p>
