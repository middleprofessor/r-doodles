description: "A very skeletal analysis of 'Human Gut Microbiota from Autism Spectrum Disorder Promote Behavioral Symptoms in Mice', which got some attention on pubpeer. Commenters are questioning the result of Fig1G. It is very hard to infer a p-value from plots like these, where the data are multi-level, regardless if means and some kind of error bar is presented. A much better plot for inferring differences is an effects plot with the CI of the effect. That said, I'll try to reproduce the resulting p-value."

<h3>Method no. 1 (as stated in caption to Fig 1)</h3>
<p>The figure caption gives the method as “Hypothesis testing for differences of the means were done by a mixed effects analysis using donor diagnosis and mouse sex as fixed effects and donor ID as a random effect. p values were derived from a chi-square test”. This would be a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). The LRT requires that the model be fit by maximum likelhood for the statistic to have any meaning. The default fit in R is REML.</p>
<p>The LRT of the model as specified in the caption of Fig1G</p>

<p>the p-value is 0.00013. Is this the reported p-value? I don’t know. A problem is that the methods section suggests a different model was used. This leads to:</p>

<div id="method-no.-2-as-stated-in-methods-section" class="section level2">
<h2>method no. 2 (as stated in methods section)</h2>
<p>“Statistical analysis for behavioral outcomes in fecal transplanted offspring. Comparison of behavioral outcomes between TD Controls and ASD donors were tested using longitudinal linear mixed effects analyses, with test cycles and donors treated as repeated factors. Analyses were performed in SPSS (v 24); a priori alpha = 0.05. All outcomes were tested for normality and transformed as required. Diagonal covariance matrices were used so that intra-cycle and intra-donor correlations were accounted for in the modeling. The donor type (TD versus ASD) was the primary fixed effect measured, and mouse sex was an a priori covariate.”</p>
<p>(I think) it would be unlikely to get the wrong LRT using SPSS. Also the specified model differs from that in the caption. Was the response transformed (note it’s not the reponse that needs to be “normal” but the residuals from the linear model (or equivalently the conditional response))</p>
