On page 606, of Lock et al "Statistics: Unlocking the Power of Data", the authors state in item D "The p-value from the ANOVA table is 0.000 so the model as a whole is effective at predicting grade point average." Ah no.
 
```{r}
library(data.table)
library(mvtnorm)
rho <- 0.5
n <- 10^5
Sigma <- diag(2)
Sigma[1,2] <- Sigma[2,1] <- rho
X <- rmvnorm(n, mean=c(0,0), sigma=Sigma)
colnames(X) <- c("X1", "X2")
beta <- c(0.01, -0.02)
y <- X%*%beta + rnorm(n)
fit <- lm(y ~ X)
summary(fit)
```
 
 A p-value is not a measure of the predictive capacity of a model because the p-value is a function of 1) signal, 2) noise (unmodeled error), and 3) sample size while predictive capacity is a function of the signal:noise ratio. If the signal:noise ratio is tiny, the predictive capacity is small but the p-value can be tiny if the sample size is large.
