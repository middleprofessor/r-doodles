The example data are from Figure 4b of

[Gómez-Banoy, Nicolás, et al. "Adipsin preserves beta cells in diabetic mice and associates with protection from type 2 diabetes in humans." Nature medicine 25.11 (2019): 1739-1747.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0895-y){target="_blank"}

The design is $2 \times 2$ factorial (two experimental factors each with two levels). I probably wouldn't communicate treatments this way but it does have the advantage that treatment combinations are easy to see even if the plot were black-and-white (but why would anyone use black and white in 2020?).
