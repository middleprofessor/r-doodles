The motivation for this post was to create a pipeline for generating publication-ready plots entirely within ggplot and avoid post-generation touch-ups in Illustrator or Inkscape. These scripts are a start. The ideal modification would be turning the chunks into functions with personalized detail so that a research team could quickly and efficiently generate multiple plots. I might try to turn the scripts into a very-general-but-not-ready-for-r-package function for my students.

# Background

The example data are from Figure 4b of

[Gómez-Banoy, Nicolás, et al. "Adipsin preserves beta cells in diabetic mice and associates with protection from type 2 diabetes in humans." Nature medicine 25.11 (2019): 1739-1747.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-0895-y){target="_blank"}
