<p>Warning - This is a long, exploratory post on Q-Q plots motivated by the specific data set analyzed below and the code follows my stream of thinking this through. I have not gone back through to economize length. So yeh, some repeated code Iâ€™ve turned into functions and other repeated code is repeated.</p>
<p>This post is not about <em>how</em> to interpret a Q-Q plot but about <strong>which Q-Q plot?</strong> to interpret.</p>
<p>huh?</p>
