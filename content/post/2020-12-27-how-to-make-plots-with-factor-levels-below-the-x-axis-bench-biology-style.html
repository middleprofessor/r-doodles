<p>The design is <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> factorial (two experimental factors each with two levels). I probably wouldn’t communicate treatments this way but it does have the advantage that treatment combinations are easy to see even if the plot were black-and-white (but why would anyone use black and white in 2020?).</p>
