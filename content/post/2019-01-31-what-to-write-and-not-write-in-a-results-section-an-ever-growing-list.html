<p>“GPP (n=4 per site) increased from the No Wildlife site to the Hippo site but was lowest at the Hippo + WB site (Fig. 6); <em>however, these differences were not significant due to low sample sizes and high variability.</em>” <strong>If we know these are not significant due to low sampe size and high variability, why even do the test?</strong></p>
<p>“TRE <em>led to</em> a modest, but not significant, increase in sleep duration to 449.93 ± 60.87 min for the entire cohort (+12.45 ± 49.58 min of sleep, p = 0.302)”. <strong>The researchers observed a modest difference in means</strong></p>
<p>“We also did not find significant changes in an objective measure of sleep efficiency (percent time asleep during sleep interval, −0.17% ± 1.99%, p = 0.728). <em>However, this is likely due to large differences between participants at baseline.</em>”</p>
<p>“Likewise, <em>there was a trend toward a decrease </em>in the variance of sleep onset from 3.05 h during baseline to 2.05 h during intervention (p = 0.142; Figure 2)”</p>
<p>“<em>There was a small but non-significant trend toward</em> improved sleep (decreased score) as reported on the PSQI (−0.68 ± 2.06, p = 0.164)”</p>
