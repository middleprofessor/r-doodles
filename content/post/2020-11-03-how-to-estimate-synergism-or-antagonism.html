<p>In the experiment for Figure 1 of the motivating source article, the researchers were explicitly interested in measuring any synergistic effects of <code>hac</code> and <code>indole</code> on the response. What is a synergistic effect? If <code>hac</code> and <code>indole</code> act independently, then the response should be <strong>additive</strong> â€“ the HAC+Indole effect should simply be the sum of the independent HAC and Indole effects. A HAC+Indole effect that is larger than the sum of the two independent effects is evidence of a synergistic (positive) interaction. A HAC+Indole effect that is less than the sum of the two independent effects is evidence of an antagonistic (negative) interaction.</p>
